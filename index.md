NoSleepBot (NSB): You sleep, bot doesn't.


## What's NoSleepBot?

An automatic keyboard typer with some nice functionalities like Random Text Combination.

You don't have to type on your keyboard all night long. NSB will do that for you.

## For what?

To wake your computer up, to type something repeatedly, to tell others that you are still ~~not~~ there awake.

You can technically use this on any software and website like Zoom, Messenger, Discord, Trollbox, Telegram, etc.


## Download

Latest version: v<latestversion>1</latestversion>

[Download ZIP](https://github.com/nosleepbot/nosleepbot.github.io/raw/main/NoSleepBot.zip)

**There is no Discord, Twitter, or Telegram channel. They are all fakes.**


## Installation

Extract the `.zip` file and run the `nosleepbot.exe` file. *(Recommend you to download it from the official GitHub repository)* If you think you are very cautious, you may run this on an isolated virtual machine. However, launching it in the Sandbox is not an option because this software obviously requires using your keyboard!


As this software is not code signed, you may see some warning and precaution pop-ups. Just proceed forward to click OK.

Windows 10+ and [.NET Framework 4.5.2+](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net462) are prerequisites.


## How to use it?


### Basic auto typing

Fill your text line by line in `Pool 1` or open a text file (.txt) by clicking the `Open` button.

Set `Interval` as you want. `10`~`30.5` means that the interval is randomly chosen between the values.

Click the `Start` button.

**You must locate your `cursor` on the target textbox**

You can see the 'previous' text and 'next' text that will be typed in the next cycle.

### Changing order

In `Settings`, select an option as you want.

`Random pick` for randomly picking one in the pool. There can be duplicated selections. (e.g.: 1,3,4,5,4,1,2..)

`Shuffle pick` for preventing duplicated selections. (e.g.: 1,3,4,5,2 / 4,5,1,2,3 ..)

### Combination pools

`Random mix in Pool 1` means that two lines will be selected randomly to make a single phrase.

`Shuffle Pool 1 + random Pool 2` means that one will be chosen from pool 1 without duplication and another one from pool 2 randomly.

`Concat. text` is the text that will be put between the chosen text from pool 1 and pool 2.

* You can preview the combined text in the `Next:` textbox at the bottom.

### Other options

`Use Copy-Paste rather than keypress`: NSB puts each character one by one by default. If this makes errors on your machine, you may click this checkbox. It will put the entire text at once.


* You can test all these options with your Notepad!
